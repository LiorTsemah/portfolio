## üìä Clustering Algorithm ‚Äì Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (symNMF)
- **Languages:** Python & C  
- **Description:**  
  A hybrid project combining **Python** (for data preprocessing and visualization) and **C** (for performance-critical matrix operations). Implemented a full pipeline for clustering using **symNMF**, including comparison to K-Means clustering.
- **Collaboration:** This project was done in collaboration with student Noy Netanel.
- **Repo:** [symNMF Clustering ‚Äì software_project](https://github.com/LiorTsemah/software_project)

## üå≤ AVL Tree Implementation
- **Language:** Python  
- **Description:**  
  A self-balancing binary search tree (AVL Tree) that maintains logarithmic height. Supports insertions, deletions, rotations, and balance checking.
- **Collaboration:** This project was done in collaboration with student Ella Bar.
- **Repo:** [AVL Tree ‚Äì DataStructuresE01](https://github.com/LiorTsemah/DataStructuresE01)

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Binomial Heap Implementation
- **Language:** Java  
- **Description:**  
  Implementation of a **binomial heap**, a data structure optimized for merging and priority queue operations. Developed as part of a data structures assignment.
- **Collaboration:** This project was done in collaboration with student Ella Bar.
- **Repo:** [Binomial Heap ‚Äì DataStructuresE02](https://github.com/LiorTsemah/DataStructuresE02)
