## 📂 Projects

### 🔹 [AVL Tree in Python](https://github.com/LiorTsemah/DataStructuresE01)
> A self-balancing binary search tree implemented in Python, supporting efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.  
> Developed as part of an academic project in collaboration with [Ella Hazelbar](https://github.com/ellahazelbar).

### 🔹 [Binomial Heap in Java](https://github.com/LiorTsemah/DataStructuresE02)
> Java implementation of a **Binomial Heap**, a data structure that supports efficient merging of priority queues and fast minimum extraction.

### 🔹 [K-Means Clustering – C & Python](https://github.com/LiorTsemah/software_project)
> An implementation of the **K-Means** clustering algorithm, written in both **C** and **Python**, as part of a software project course.  
> The algorithm clusters datasets based on Euclidean distance and includes performance optimizations using C extensions for Python.  
> Includes:  
> • Reading and processing input in Python  
> • Core algorithm in C for speed  
> • Full testing on multiple datasets
